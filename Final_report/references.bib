   abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical materials and provide significant values to national security, energy production, environmental protection and economic growth. The supply of REEs in U.S. solely relies on import as domestic production of REEs was ceased because of the environmental concerns during mining and lack of competitiveness. Nonetheless, unconventional REEs-containing resources, including produced water, acid mine drainage, and coal and coal byproducts (C&CBs) contain significant amounts of REEs. However, the concentrations of REEs in these resources are several orders of magnitude lower than that of REEs ores. Thus, extraction of REEs from these materials is challenging. Here we report REEs extraction with environmentally friendly method that successfully concentrated REEs from 312 ppm in fly ash to 99.4% in the final product. Especially, the five critically important REEs (Dy, Eu, Nd, Tb, and Y) account for up to ∼63% of the total weight of all REEs in the final 99.4%-purity product. Coal fly ash is one of the major solid coal utilization byproducts, representing great potential resources for REEs extraction. Extraction of REEs from these unconventional resources could be the way to secure domestic supply of these critical materials.},

   abstract = {Critical metals play an irreplaceable role in supporting the development of the global economy and emerging industries. Their short supply makes the recovery of critical metals from alternative sources, such as coal ash, a research hotspot. In this study, Chongqing Power Plant coal and its combustion products, which are rich in a variety of critical metal elements, were selected for the study. The enrichment, distribution, and occurrence mode of critical elements in the products of coal combustion was studied, and improved sequential chemical extraction procedure, and their extraction potential was proposed and discussed. The results show that the contents of the most critical elements in different coal ashes are generally high in the order of fly ash, slag, and bottom ash. The critical elements Li, Ga, Sr, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) are enriched in fly ash and the contents of Ga, Nb, and REY exceed their respective industrial utilization grades, which have great recovery potential. Lithium, Ga, Nb, Ta, and REY are mainly distributed in small particle sizes in non-magnetic fly ash and occur in aluminosilicate glass, followed by mullite and quartz. Three categories of extractability are proposed: easy-to-extract form, relatively easy-to-extract, and difficult-to-extract forms. Finally, future research should focus on the collaborative extraction of multiple critical elements (such as Li, Ga, Nb, and REY) from coal ash.},

The rock samples, with abundant quartz and metamorphic Al-Si minerals and with a lower ash-basis REE concentration than the coals, were distinctly separated from the coal samples on the PCA plots. Plots of GdN/GdN* vs. EuN/EuN* and CeN/CeN* vs. EuN/ EuN* showed differentiation between the individual suites of coals showed that the refuse samples had distinct REE distributions compared to the associated coals.

   abstract = {The impacts of calcination on the leaching recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) and other critical metals from a Baker seam coal refuse material were investigated in this study. Acid leaching test results showed that leaching recovery of the REEs, especially the light REEs, was increased significantly from around 24% to 80–90% after calcination under 600–750 °C for two hours. By considering the major element leaching kinetics and the mineralogical changes of the dominant minerals caused by calcination, two mechanisms were proposed for the improved leaching performance: (1) decomposition of difficult-to-dissolve REE-bearing minerals into soluble forms; and (2) liberation of REE-bearing minerals encapsulated in clays after calcination due to the dehydration and disintegration of the layered clay structure. Sequential chemical extraction tests showed that a significant fraction (around 75%) of the REEs in the raw material were present in an insoluble form. After calcination under proper temperatures (600–800 °C), the majority of the insoluble light REEs (LREEs) were converted into soluble forms. Changes in the modes of occurrence of the LREEs and phosphorous based on leaching rate and sequential leaching correlated well as a function of the calcination temperature. This finding in addition to SEM-EDX results tends to indicate the potential that the LREEs occur primarily as rare earth phosphates such as monazite in the untreated coal refuse material. The acid leaching and sequential chemical extraction results show that co-extraction of REEs and other critical metals such as Co, Mn, and Li is possible using a calcination-acid leaching procedure.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses the modes of occurrence of critical elements and their origins in the studied coal and associated rock samples (partings and roof strata) from the Datanhao coal mine, Daqingshan Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, northern China. The studied coals are enriched in trace elements including Zr, Hf, Th, Be, F, Zn, Ga, Nb, Mo, Cd, In, Sn, Ta, Hg, W, Pb, and rare earth elements and Y (REY). Zirconium, Nb, Ta, and Hf are largely associated with anatase in the studied coal and non-coal samples. The main carriers of REY, Th, and U in both coal and non-coal samples are Ca-bearing REE-phosphate minerals, most likely monazite, although U is partly associated with organic matter. Fluorine in the Datanhao coals is mainly associated with kaolinite. Most partings identified as volcanic ash-derived tonsteins from the Datanhao Mine exhibit negative Eu anomalies that, along with the common presence of equant-shaped euhedral volcanic quartz (beta-quartz), indicate a felsic volcanic source located in the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt. Other probable sources of clastic material into the basin include the pre-Cambrian granites from the adjacent uplands, which may be responsible for the light rare earth element enrichment of the studied deposits, and associated metamorphic rocks from the adjacent uplands. Owing to acidic hydrothermal fluids, which are most likely related to the Yanshanian (Jurassic to Early Cretaceous) intrusive activity and/or low-temperature basinal waters circulating within the coal-bearing unit during the epigenetic stage, most of the coal benches from the Datanhao mine are also relatively enriched in middle rare earth elements. On the other hand, some coal and non-coal bench samples from the middle Datanhao section are enriched in heavy REE. This, along with the presence of abundant syngenetic or early diagenetic carbonate minerals, indicates deposition in an episodic alkaline environment, the origin of which is mostly probably attributed to evaporation and/or saline water inputs resembling a playa lake environment. As the concentrations of Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta are all close to or higher than the respective industry cut-off grades or standards for these critical elements, the Datanhao coal seam has potential economic significance for these as an important by-product of the coal mining.},

   abstract = {Coal is a complex geologic material composed mainly of organic matter and mineral matter, the latter including minerals, poorly crystalline mineraloids, and elements associated with non-mineral inorganics. Among mineral matter, minerals play the most significant role in affecting the utilization of coal, although, in low rank coals, the non-mineral elements may also be significant. Minerals in coal are often regarded as a nuisance being responsible for most of the problems arising during coal utilization, but the minerals are also seen as a potentially valuable source of critical metals and may also, in some cases, have a beneficial effect in coal gasification and liquefaction. With a few exceptions, minerals are the major hosts of the vast majority of elements present in coal. In this review paper, we list >200 minerals that have been identified in coal and its low temperature ash, although the validity of some of these minerals has not been confirmed. Base on chemical compositions, minerals found in coal can be classified into silicate, sulfide and selenide, phosphate, carbonate, sulfate, oxide and hydroxide, and others. On the basis of their abundance, they can be classified into common, uncommon, and rare. Elements associated with silicates are largely benign, but many of those associated with sulfides and selenides are toxic to the environment and human health (e.g., S, As, Hg, Tl, Se, and Pb). Critical elements, e.g., rare earth elements and Y, Ga, and Al, are mostly associated with clays, phosphate, and carbonate minerals. There are many unusual mineral phases, such as native W, Au, Ag, and various Pt phases, which may have economic and geochemical significance in coal. Although the modes of mineral occurrence of a number of elements have been widely investigated, there are some elements whose associations, and, in particular, association mechanism with minerals are, to a degree, uncertain or even largely unknown and deserve further attention.},

As the gap between their global demand and supply increases, the search for their alternative resources becomes more and more important, especially for the countries which depend highly on their import. Coal fly ash (CFA), which when not utilised is considered waste, has been regarded as the possible source of many elements, including REE. Due to the increase in the energy demand, CFA production is expected to grow, making research into the use of this material a necessity. As Poland is the second biggest coal consumer in the European Union, the authors have studied different coal fly ashes from ten Polish power plants for their rare earth element content. All the fly ashes have a broadly similar distribution of rear earth elements, with light REE being dominant. Most of the samples have REE content relatively high and according to Seredin and Dai (Int J Coal Geol 94: 67–93, 2012) classification can be considered promising REE raw materials.},

Global demand for REE is expected to increase sharply in the coming decades, especially for certain energy-critical REE (e.g., Y and Nd), spurring investigations into novel sources of REEs. Polluted mine drainage from eastern U.S. coalfields contains elevated concentrations of dissolved Fe, Al, and Mn and is also enriched in REE by up to three orders of magnitude over unpolluted groundwater. Mine drainage remediation systems, designed to precipitate dissolved metals, can sequester >90% of dissolved REE into the precipitated solids (treatment solids). These solids, landfilled at cost to treatment system operators, are a promising REE source. Passive treatment systems with diverse geochemical environments were sampled to determine REE mobility in these systems and REE concentrations in treatment solids. Passive treatment systems were found to produce middle and heavy REE-enriched solids, relative to the North American Shale Composite, with up to 1950 ppm REE and 55% energy-critical REE. SEM-EDS and synchrotron μ-XRF analysis demonstrate the association of REE with Mn-oxide coatings on limestone from a passive treatment system. Calculated concentration factors indicate that passive treatment systems using natural processes (e.g., drainable limestone beds and vertical flow ponds) concentrate REE into treatment solids approximately three times more effectively compared to active treatment systems using caustic chemical additions (e.g., lime). This study suggests that passive treatment systems effectively concentrate REE into treatment solids and these solids could be an alternative and more environmentally friendly source of REE compared to conventional mining on land or the seafloor. Results of this study can also aid in the design of treatment systems engineered to remove and concentrate critical REE which could provide a financial incentive to treat polluted mine water.},

   abstract = {Rare earth elements (REE) are critical raw materials crucial for modern technologies and used in a variety of industries. There is a need of investment in REE recovery from secondary sources. The present work was designed to assess the potential of the electrodialytic process to recover REE from coal ash. The content of REE was evaluated in bituminous and anthracite ash. Anthracite presented higher REE concentration (447 ppm vs. 138 ppm) and a triple concentration of critical REE compared with bituminous ash. Anthracite ash was treated aiming to test the REE recover potential, including differences between light REE (LREE) and heavy REE (HREE) fractions as well as the specific recovery of REE with high criticality. A two-compartment electrodialytic cell was tested with the matrix placed in the anode compartment and a cation-exchange membrane separating the compartments. Experiments lasted a maximum of 7 days applying different current intensities and pH adjustment in the catholyte (≈ 2). Three main steps are observed in the removal process 1) REE solubilization - from the solid to the liquid phase (anolyte); 2) REE mobilization - movement from the anolyte towards the cathode end; 3) REE removal - presence in the catholyte. The extent of each step observed for the REE depends on their individual position in the periodic table with HREE removal being more regulated by step 1 and LREE by step 2. At the best tested conditions (50 mA, 3 days, pH adjustment), more than 70% of REE were extracted from the ash with the catholyte enclosing up to ≈ 50% of LREE and HREE. Combining the high criticality of neodymium with its high concentration in anthracite coal ash (65 ppm), the electrodialytic treatment is highly recommended to concentrate this REE in the catholyte. The results demonstrated the proof-of-concept for electro-assisted extraction of REE from anthracite coal ash, opening perspectives to a selective recovery of these elements from secondary sources.},

   abstract = {Coal fly ash is a promising alternative source for rare earth elements (REE), which are critical materials in many technologies. REEs are entrained in the aluminosilicate glass of the fly ash particles, hindering their ability to solubilize during acid leaching. The purpose of this research was to test the effectiveness of roasting techniques to improve extraction of REEs from fly ash, determine key parameters controlling REE extraction, and understand trade-offs in reagent use. Representative coal ash samples from major U.S. coal basins (Appalachian, Illinois, and Powder River basins) were roasted using a variety of chemical additives (Na2O2, NaOH, CaO, Na2CO3, CaSO4, (NH4)2SO4). Further experiments investigated the effects of additive:ash ratio, roasting temperature, and leachate pH on REE extraction. We found that NaOH roasting often recovered >90% of total REE content, equivalent to the USGS-recommended method (Na2O2 sintering). Other additives tested recovered <50% of total REE content; the 450 °C sinter temperature, which was well below the melting points of these agents, may have been a contributing factor. Decreasing the NaOH-ash ratio did not significantly inhibit in REE recoveries, while increasing the leachate pH led to a sharp decline. There was a strong positive correlation between REE extraction and leachate H+ molarity. Recoveries of ~100% were observed for the Powder River Basin ash sample regardless of the roasting agent and additive:ash ratio used. This suggests that acid leaching alone is sufficient for recovering REEs from more soluble Powder River Basin ashes. For Appalachian and Illinois Basin ashes, the recommended roasting conditions for >70% REE extraction are a 1:1 NaOH-ash ratio and leaching with 1–2 mol/L HNO3.},

A number of research groups are exploring technologies to separate REEs from coal ash and supercritical extraction has emerged as a high yield contender. Estimating the economic viability of this lab-scale process at the industrial scale is both important and challenging. In this study we estimate industrial scale cost and revenues of production of REEs from coal ash by combining prior laboratory results, scaling models, combinatorial scenarios and sensitivity analysis. The processing cost of extracting REEs from one ton of coal ash using supercritical CO2 and tributylphosphate (TBP) is found to vary between $380 and $1200 for 550 g of REE. The value of REE oxides that may be obtained per ton of ash is estimated to vary between $6 and $557, with a median of $250. Scandium is the most expensive REE and can account for up to 90% of the value of the yield. The results suggest that factors critical to the economic viability of the process include scandium content & yield, reagent use, and processing time.},

Factors controlling REY anomalies in coal deposits include the geochemistry of terrigenous source rocks, ingress of hydrothermal fluids, influence of marine environments, percolating natural waters, volcanic ashes, and sedimentary environments of peat formation.

   abstract = {Recovery of rare earth elements (REEs), especially heavy and critical REEs, from alternative resources such as coal refuse has recently become increasingly important. A natural leachate containing 6.14 ppm of REEs with a pH value of 2.70 was collected from a coal coarse refuse pile and utilized as a feedstock for REE recovery tests. The pH value of the natural leachate was gradually increased in a step-wise manner using a sodium hydroxide solution which produced several precipitates. A precipitate containing about 1.1% total REEs was obtained in the pH range of 4.85–6.11 while recovering >80% of the REEs contained in the original leachate. The leaching and staged precipitation process enriched both the critical and heavy REE fractions. The ratios of heavy-to-light (H/L) and critical-to-uncritical (C/UC) REEs in the precipitate were much higher than the coarse refuse material (H/L: 1.54 vs 0.21, C/UC: 1.51 vs 0.34). Additionally, the precipitate contained 18.4% Al, 1.7% Zn, 1.4% Cu, 1.1% Mn, 0.5% Ni and 0.2% Co. A solution chemistry study indicated that the hydroxide and hydroxysulphate precipitates of Al, Si and Cu produced in the pH range of 4.85–6.11 contributed to the fractionation of the REEs and other metal ions such as Zn, Mn and Co to the precipitate. The iron hydroxide precipitates formed at lower pH values did not contain a significant amount of REEs. An explanation may be the competitive adsorption between Al, which was present at higher solution concentrations, and REEs on the iron hydroxide and/or hydroxysulphate precipitate surfaces as proven by results of precipitation tests conducted on model solutions. A product containing 94% of a rare earth oxide mix was obtained by re-dissolution of the REE enriched precipitates followed by selective precipitation using oxalic acid. The overall results including an economic assessment indicate that leachate solutions generated naturally from coarse coal refuse may be a valuable source of critical and heavy REEs that can be effectively recovered and concentrated using staged precipitation.},

   abstract = {Coal contains trace amounts of rare earth elements (REE). They are either in the form of discrete minerals or chemically bound to organic matter. Methods of distinguishing the organic and inorganic associations of REE in coal have been mostly based on the correlations between the REE concentrations and the ash yields. Quantitative characterization of organically associated REE is still very challenging. In this work, we confirm the existence of organically-associated REE in coal and present an approach to quantifying its mass fraction. The coal sample used in this study was a cleaned low-ash coal collected from a coal preparation plant in Kentucky, USA and originally from the central Appalachian basin coal region. The results from particle size and density separations of the coal suggested that the REE are associated with both organic and inorganic matters. It was found that as the ash yield increases, both the total REE concentration on the whole coal basis and the LREE/HREE ratio increase, while the total REE concentration on the ash basis reduces dramatically. The results also suggested that the organic matter is relatively enriched in HREE. Based on these observation and findings, a method was developed to quantitatively determine the distribution of REE in the organic and inorganic phases of the coal. It was found that the total REE concentrations in the organic and inorganic phases are 31 ppm and 1141 ppm, respectively. The results also showed that in the low-ash Appalachian coal sample used in this work, 25% of the REE is associated with the organic matter. The method developed in this work for quantitative evaluation of the organic/inorganic mode of occurrence may be applied to other coal samples and for many other trace elements in coals.},

The concern about the REE supply challenge has stimulated global interest in recovering REE from alternative non-conventional REE sources such as coal fly ash. In this paper, sequential extraction, physical separations and hydrothermal alkaline treatment were explored for characterization and enrichment of REE from coal fly ash. Seven-step sequential extraction of coal fly ash has demonstrated that 86.1% of total REE were associated with the glassy phase of the fly ash, with the remaining REE mainly distributed in the organic and sulfides phase (8.3%), the exchangeable phase (3.7%), and the carbonates phase (1.5%). A process combining physical separations, namely, particle size separation and magnetic separation, and hydrothermal alkaline treatment was proposed for enrichment of REE from coal fly ash. The optimal hydrothermal alkaline treatment condition was determined. It was demonstrated that NaOH concentration, solid-to-liquid ratio, temperature, and reaction duration had significant influence on ash dissolution in NaOH solution. Grinding could also enhance ash dissolution during subsequent hydrothermal alkaline treatment. REE were enriched from coal fly ash from 325 mg/kg to 877 mg/kg via the proposed process under optimal hydrothermal alkaline treatment conditions.},

Furthermore, the hydrometallurgical leaching of REEs from coal and coal discard is reviewed and a summary of recent outcomes on REEs recovery from the coal source is presented. The review validated the technical feasibility of the physical beneficiation of REE minerals from coal without a significant particle size reduction to produce high-grade REE feedstocks for leaching. Although ultrafine milling results in higher REE recovery values, additional milling costs may affect the viability of the process. Overall, the study confirms the abundance of REEs in coal, identifies gaps in knowledge, and highlighs future research that must be addressed to advance REEs recovery from these sources.},

In this study, an integrated flowsheet was developed based on laboratory test data which combines physical separation, pyrite bio-oxidization, heap leaching, selective precipitation and solvent extraction processes. The test data was obtained from (1) characterization of a number of natural leachate and solid samples collected from different preparation plants which process coals from a number of coal seams and (2) laboratory acid leaching and selective precipitation tests results. The highly-valued critical REEs (i.e., Y, Nd, Eu, Tb and Dy) were selectively leached from the refuse samples in the natural environment due to the acid generated by pyrite oxidization. The leachate samples were evaporated to remove water and obtain residual solids (i.e., dissolved solids in the leachates). The total REE content in the dissolved solids from a given leachate sample was 380 ppm, which was higher than the REE content of the coarse refuse material that generated the leachate (322 ppm). Acid leaching tests recovered as much as 80% of the total REEs from the coarse refuse samples using a 1.2 M sulfuric acid solution. Afterwards, the pH of the leachate was increased in a step-wise fashion which resulted in the production of precipitates containing 0.3–1.1% total REEs. A significant amount of contaminants, such as Fe, Al, and Ca, were eliminated in the sequential precipitation process, which allowed further upgrading using oxalic acid precipitation and/or solvent extraction. In the proposed flowsheet, the coarse refuse is arranged in heap leach pads and the acid needed for REE leaching is primarily produced from pyrite bio-oxidization, which enhances the selectivity of REE recovery and significantly reduces the cost. The successful application of the flowsheet would result in significant benefits to both the coal and rare earth industries.},

   abstract = {The recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from coal combustion fly ash has recently gained attention as a possible beneficial reuse application that could provide an alternative, low-grade source of REEs in an unstable global supply market. To economically recover REEs, an efficient process needs to be developed to remove them from the ash. This study investigated different methods of leaching REEs from fly ash and other coal combustion ashes. Aqueous acid and alkaline leaching were employed on multiple types of coal fly ash samples (representing coals from three major U.S. coal basin sources) with variable leaching parameters that include extractant type (HCl, NaOH), extractant concentration, leachate-to-ash ratio, and addition of CaO during the leaching process. Acid leaching of high calcium-containing fly ashes such as samples derived from Powder River Basin coals had the highest recoveries of REEs (near 100% of total REE contents), while leaching efficiencies were much lower (<40%) for low calcium fly ashes from Appalachian and Illinois Basin coals. If the fly ashes were subjected to aqueous NaOH (to decompose alumunosilicates) and followed with dilute acid to maintain solubility of metal cations, recoveries of the REEs was up to 85% for Appalachian ashes. Overall, these results demonstrate that REEs in the Powder River Basin-based coal fly ashes are more easily leached into acidic solution than the other ashes tested. While the Appalachian Basin-based coal ashes contained the highest total REEs concentrations out of all regional coal ash sources, these ashes required more complex leaching methods that first decompose the aluminosilicate glassy matrix of the ash (e.g. alkaline digestion) prior to acid leaching.},

The concern about the REE supply challenge has led to increasing interest and research in the recovery of REE from end-of-life products and secondary sources such as coal and coal by-products. The work reported here was focused on examining the technical feasibility of physical separation techniques for the enrichment of REE from coal and coal by-products. Particle size, magnetic and density separations were performed on coal, coal ash, clay and shale samples. It was found that the samples responded to particle size separation differently. For all ash samples, higher REE concentrations were found in the finer fractions. For the clay and shale samples, however, the REE concentrations decrease as the particle size reduces possibly because RE minerals were not effectively released by grinding. Magnetic separation showed that REE are enriched in non-magnetic fractions for all ash samples. All samples responded similarly to density separation. Among the three methods, density separation showed the highest enrichment of REE. A combination of these methods is recommended. Finally, correlations between elements were demonstrated, which leads to the classification of three groups containing mainly Al/Si, Fe and Ca, respectively. REE are strongly associated with the Al/Si group.},

   abstract = {Due to the increasing criticality of rare earth elements (REEs), it has become essential to recover REEs from alternative resources. In this study, systematic REEs leaching tests were performed on the calcination product of a coal coarse refuse using hydrochloric acid and different types of organic acid as lixiviants. Experimental results show that the recovery of REEs, especially heavy REEs (HREEs) and scandium (Sc), is improved by using selected organic acids. Citric acid and DL-malic acid afford the best leaching performances; whereas, malonic acid, oxalic acid, and DL-tartaric acid are inferior to hydrochloric acid. Results of zeta potential measurements and solution chemical equilibrium calculations show that malonic acid is more likely adsorbed on the surface of the calcined material compared with citric acid and DL-malic acid. The adsorption may reduce the effective concentration of malonic species in solution and/or increase the amount of REEs adsorbed on the surface, thereby impairing the leaching recovery. Compared with light REEs (LREEs), a stronger adsorption of the HREEs on the surface is observed from electro-kinetic test results. This finding explains why organic acids impose a more positive impact on the leaching recovery of HREEs. By complexing with the HREEs, organic acids can keep the metal ions in solution and improve the leaching recovery. The adsorption of Sc3+ on the surface is the lowest compared with other REEs. Therefore, rather than complexing, the organic anionic species likely play a function of solubilizing Sc from the solid, which is similar to that of hydrogen ions.},

Samples were collected from several coal mines and three boreholes. In total, 105 samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), including 69 coals, 31 shales, and 5 paleosols. Concentrations of REY in the coals vary from less than 200 ppm to more than 3000 ppm (on ash basis). Indirect evidence, including REY versus ash relationships, REY distribution patterns, and REY content in raw coal compared to that in washed coal, suggests that the organic association may be an important mode of REY occurrence in these coals. The Lower Block and the Upper Block Coal Members of the Brazil Formation and some coals of the Staunton Formation have the highest REY concentrations among those studied. Concentrations of REY in marine shales range from less than 200 to 800 ppm on ash basis. The majority of shale samples studied vary little from the REY values of the continental crust, but some show enrichments. Our results suggest that, while post-combustion coal ash of the high-REY coals are a potential source of these elements, significant efforts and resources are needed to make the studied shales a viable REY resource.},

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a biosorption-based approach to recover REEs from leachate solutions derived from North Dakota lignite coal and Powder River Basin (PRB) coal fly ash. A pairwise comparison was performed using a range of cell densities of two distinct bacteria, including an Escherichia coli strain previously genetically engineered for cell surface display of lanthanide binding tags, and Arthrobacter nicotianae, a native bacterium that exhibits high REE adsorption capacity. At optimal cell densities, we observed a recovery efficiency of 80% for total REEs and > 90% for middle and heavy REEs from the lignite leachate. Higher cell densities were required to achieve a similar total REE recovery efficiency in the PRB leachate due to its higher non-REE content, which negatively impacted light REE recovery. Despite the chemical complexity of both feedstocks, separation factors ≥ 30 were observed for Nd relative to nearly all non-REE metals after a single adsorption/desorption cycle, highlighting the high adsorption selectivity for REEs. Quantification of impurities in the extracted metal solutions revealed that Ca and Mg content in the leachate solutions play a dominant role in both the REE recovery yield and purity. The Mg/Ca impurities can be further reduced by incorporation of a low pH wash step between the adsorption and desorption steps, yielding extracted concentrates with a REE purity (mass fraction REE of total metals) of 80% and 50% for lignite and PRB, respectively. Thermodynamic speciation analysis of the REE-enriched eluents from both feedstocks suggests that at a post-biosorption hydroxide precipitation step can be employed to yield high purity total REE precipitates. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of biosorption for selective REE recovery from coal byproducts and pave the way for a sustainable route to diversify the REE supply chain.},

This testing was aimed at understanding the modes of occurrence of the REE in the lignite coals, as well as to provide foundational data for development of rare earth extraction processes. In a first series of tests, a sequential leaching process was used to investigate modes of occurrence of the REE of select lignite coals. The tests involved sequential exposure to solvents consisting of water, ammonium acetate and dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). The results indicated that water and ammonium acetate extracted very little of the REE, indicating the REE are not present as water soluble or ion-exchangeable forms. However, the data shows that a large percentage of the REE were extracted with the hydrochloric acid (80–95 wt%), suggesting presence in HCl-soluble mineral forms such as carbonates, and/or presence as organic complexes. A second series of tests was performed involving single-step leaching with dilute acids and various operating parameters, including acid type, acid concentration, acid/coal contact time and coal particle size. For select samples, additional tests were performed to understand the results of leaching, including float-sink density separations and humic acid extraction. The results have shown that the majority of REE in Fort Union lignites appear to be associated weakly with the organic matrix of the coals, most likely as coordination complexes of carboxylic acid groups. The light REE and heavy REE exhibit different behaviors, however. The extractable light REE appear to have association both in acid-soluble mineral forms and as organic complexes, whereas the extractable heavy REE appear to be almost solely associated with the organics. Scandium behavior was notably different than yttrium and the lanthanides, and the data suggests the extractable content is primarily associated as acid-soluble mineral forms.},

   abstract = {The recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from coal ash has gained growing attention as a promising resource recovery strategy. Compared to extensive studies on REE occurrence in coal and coal ash, few studies have investigated REE behaviors during coal combustion processes. This study investigated the mineralogy, oxidation state, and structure changes of twelve representative REE-bearing phases during heating up to 1500 °C using complementary thermal analysis, in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in order to better understand and predict REE behaviors during coal combustion processes. It was found that: (1) REE-lignin and REE-chitosan complexes, hydrated Y2(CO3)3 and Ce2(CO3)3, bastnäsite, and REE-doped calcite transformed to corresponding oxides after heating, accompanied by Ce(III) oxidation; (2) hydrated YPO4 and CePO4 formed corresponding anhydrous REE phosphates after heating with no evident Ce(III) oxidation; and (3) apatite, monazite, xenotime, and zircon barely altered during heating, although Ce(III) in apatite was partially oxidized and Y local structure became more disordered in apatite, monazite, and zircon. These results are consistent with previous studies on REE speciation in coal and coal ash and provided an in-depth understanding on REE behaviors during coal combustion, including mineral transformations and retention of REE-bearing phases. XAS analysis revealed that due to the co-existence of different REEs, mineralogical changes, and local structural distortion of REE-bearing phases during combustion, quantification of REE speciation in coal ash using XAS should be interpreted with caution and cross-validated by other techniques.},

However, limited research has been conducted on methods to recover and refine the REEs. This paper reports the results of a detailed study into the potential of selectively recovering REEs in an Illinois basin coal source by leaching. Leaching characteristics are obtained for several segments obtained from a core sample as well as three different reject materials collected at a coal processing plant. Using a 1.2 mol/L sulfuric acid solution at 75 °C, over 60% REE recovery is achieved from the direct floor and an inner parting material as well as the coal-rich core segments that are pretreated by low-temperature plasma oxidation to obtain access to the micro-dispersed mineral matter. In the leachable parting material, fluorapatite is detected by XRD analysis, which is one of the more soluble phosphate minerals with a documented association with REEs. For the three plant reject samples, the leaching recovery values obtained for the heavy REEs are higher than those obtained for the light REEs under the standard leaching conditions and when 0.1 mol/L (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 was used to extract REEs by an ion exchange mechanism. Thermal activation by roasting or chemical activation by pretreatment using 8 mol/L NaOH solution increases the total REE recovery with significantly higher gains obtained for the light REEs. Leaching kinetics are relatively fast within the first 2 h and then slow to provide relatively low overall recovery values under the standard test conditions for the coarse and fine reject samples. However, significantly higher recovery values are realized when treating mixed-phase (middling) particles existing within the coarse reject material.},

Major components of coal ash were found to be mineral oxides, mainly composed of Si, Fe, Al, and Ca, and residual carbons. Bottom and fly ashes were found to contain 185.8 mg/kg and 179.2 mg/kg of REEs, respectively. Tessier sequential extraction confirmed that 85 % of REEs are included in the residual fraction of both bottom and fly ashes. Furthermore, BCR sequential extraction revealed that 60–70 % of REEs are contained within the residual fraction, thereby indicating that REEs are strongly bound in both bottom and fly ashes and the use of very strong acids is required for the thorough extraction of REEs from coal ash. Additionally, it was found that 46.3 % of REEs can be recovered from the wastewaters produced during the process of coal ash-derived zeolite synthesis.},

   abstract = {In this paper, geochemical characteristics of rare earth elements (REE) in acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Sitai coal mine of Shanxi Province, North China were investigated by determining concentrations of dissolved REEs and major solutes in the AMD samples, concentrations of REEs in the AMD precipitate samples and country rock samples (mudstone and coal), and modeling REEs species in the AMD. The results show that AMD in the Sitai coal mine have high REEs and SO42- concentrations in comparison with several terrestrial waters worldwide. The REE speciation modeling indicates that sulfate complexes (LnSO4+, > 60%) and free metal species (Ln3+, 20%-40%) are dominant REEs species in the AMD. AMD of the Sitai coal mine also shows a middle REE-enriched NASC (North American Shale Composite)-normalized pattern. The authors suggest that both REE sulfates (LnSO4+) in the AMD and country rock of coal measures are possible reasons for middle REE-enriched NASC-normalized pattern of the Sitai coal mine AMD. Further work on the AMD precipitates is needed to obtain more information on the origin of the middle REE-enriched NASC-normalized patterns. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Rare earth element (REE) binding environments and associated mineral phases in coal and coal combustion byproducts (CCBs) are not well understood. Advanced characterization of REEs' binding environments before, during, and after production can be vital in establishing an economically viable recovery method for REEs from these materials. This study characterized different REE distributions, cerium (Ce) oxidation states, and Ce binding environments in 11 CCBs collected from various locales via X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). Bulk Ce LIII edge XANES identified Ce(III) (>85%) as the predominant Ce oxidation state in all studied samples. Ce speciation and XRF elemental map analyses further reveal the REEs in studied samples can be (1) dispersed throughout the aluminosilicate glass phase, (2) as micro-particles in large glass grain, or (3) as independent trace phases in studied samples. Both fly ash and bottom ash contain mainly Ce(III) micro-hotspots (<40 μm), co-localization with a range of elements, including, but not limited to: P, S, Ca, Ti, and Mn. At microscale, Ce can change from Ce(III) to mixture of Ce(III) and Ce(IV) and to 100% Ce(IV) oxide, revealing potential REE-phase decomposition and oxidation in coal and coal combustion process. Our study also observed intraparticle and interparticle distribution difference between light REEs and heavy REEs. The synchrotron-based characterization confirmed the presence of these trace, previously only theorized, phases during the combustion process and ultimately may inform the simplification of separation and extraction processes for REE from different CCBs.},

The coal samples were collected from three different resources, i.e., Fire Clay, West Kentucky No. 13, and Illinois No. 6 seams. Sequential extraction tests indicated that the majority of REEs in the calcined samples occurred as metal oxides especially for the West Kentucky No. 13 calcined material (54% of total REEs), which is distinct from untreated coal and combustion byproducts from pulverized coal boilers reported in literature. In addition, heavy REEs were more likely associated with easily dissolvable forms (i.e., ion-exchangeable, carbonates, and metal oxides). The calcined samples were leached under weak acidic conditions with and without adding ammonium sulfate to recover REEs. About 13%, 24%, and 20% of the REEs were extracted from the Fire Clay, West Kentucky No. 13, and Illinois No. 6 materials, respectively, by leaching at pH 4.0. The addition of 1 M ammonium sulfate further increased the recovery values to 18%, 45%, and 32%, respectively. In addition, about 64% of HREEs were extracted from the West Kentucky No. 13 calcined material under this condition. As such, a significant portion of the REEs can be easily extracted from the samples obtained by calcining the coals at 600 ℃.},

   abstract = {During coal combustion for electric power generation, rare earth elements (REE) are strongly retained in the ash fraction leading to significant enrichment compared to the REE content of the respective feed coals. Knowing how the REE are distributed in coal ash is essential to devising effective approaches for REE extraction from this potential resource. To better understand the distribution of REE in coal ash, we used the Stanford-USGS SHRIMP-RG ion microprobe to determine grain-scale REE partitioning in a suite of 19 U.S. and international coal fly ash samples. SHRIMP-RG microanalysis used a nominal spot size of 15 μm and an oxygen negative-ion primary beam. NIST multi-element glass standards SRM 611 and SRM 613 were used for REE calibration. Prior to SHRIMP-RG analysis, samples were characterized by backscattered electron imaging and wavelength-dispersive elemental mapping to delineate constituents of interest for REE microanalysis. Results confirm the occurrence of REE in aluminosilicate glasses consistent with previous results that showed a strong positive correlation between Al and REE content in a larger group of U.S. and international coal fly ash samples. Among these glasses, aluminosilicates consisting of Al and Si and lacking other major constituents tend to have REE contents similar to, or slightly lower than the bulk sample REE content, whereas Ca- and/or Fe-enriched aluminosilicate glasses are similar to, or more REE-enriched than the bulk sample. Co-occurring quartz and/or high-silica glass is almost always the most REE depleted fly ash constituent, having much lower REE contents than the aluminosilicate glasses. Fe-oxide magnetospheres have REE content with relative proportions of light (LREE) to heavy (HREE) rare earths that are more variable than in the aluminosilicate glasses. Results suggest that extraction of REE from the aluminosilicate glass fraction in coal ash will yield a significant portion of the REE present and therefore, this fraction should be targeted in ongoing efforts to recover REE from coal fly ash.},

   abstract = {The rare earth elements (REEs) in coals are important because of: (a) REE patterns can be an indicator of the nature of source rocks of the mineral matter as well as sedimentary environments; (b) REEs abundance in coal may have industrial-significance. In this study, a total of thirty-four samples of Permian coal, partings, roof, and floor were collected from the Huaibei Coalfield, Anhui Province, China. Abundances of rare earth elements (REEs) and other elements in the samples were determined by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled-plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results show that the REEs are enriched in coals in the Huaibei Coalfield as compared with Chinese and U.S. coals and the world coal average. Coals in the Lower Shihezi Formation (No. 7, 5, and 4 Coals) and Upper Shihezi Formation (No. 3) have higher REE abundances than the coals in Shanxi Formation (No. 10). Magmatic intrusion resulted in high enrichment of REEs concentrations in No. 5 and 7 Coals. The REE abundances are positively correlated with the ash content. The mineral matter in these coals is mainly made up of clay minerals and carbonates. The REEs are positively correlated with lithophile elements including Si, Al, Ti, Fe, and Na, which are mainly distributed in clay minerals, indicating that REEs are contained mainly in clay minerals. The REE abundances in coals normalized by the ash are higher than that in partings. REEs abundances of coals cannot be accounted for by the REE content in the mineral matter, and some REEs associated with organic matter in coals. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, simple dry pre-processing methods that can produce REE-enriched fractions from the fly ash could improve the feasibility of subsequent extraction processes. The performed air classification experiments with a coal combustion fly ash showed a certain size dependence of the REE concentrations. In the different size fractions the REEs were enriched or depleted. Thereby, the different groups of REEs showed differences in their behavior. In the finest size fraction all REEs were enriched by a factor of 1.05 to 1.65. In contrast, in the coarsest size fraction and in the second finest size fraction all REEs were depleted (0.63 to 0.78 and 0.58 to 0.92). In the medium size fraction the concentrations were close to those in the fly ash and in the second largest size fraction the light REEs (La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) were enriched by a factor of 1.19 to 1.35, while the concentrations of the other REEs were similar as in the fly ash. Thus, air classification shows some potential as a simple dry pre-processing step for the separation of REE-enriched fractions from the bulk of a coal fly ash.},

We carried out a study on the rare earth elements (REEs) in the inhalable particulate matter (PM10) emitted from burning coals and soil-coal honeycomb briquettes with different volatile contents and ash yields in a combustion-dilution system. Gravimetric analysis indicates that the equivalent mass concentration of the PM10 emitted from burning the coals is higher than that emitted from burning the briquettes. The ICP-MS analysis indicates that the contents of total REEs in the coal-burning PM10 are lower than those in the briquette-burning PM10. In addition, the contents of the light rare earth elements (LREEs) are higher than those of the heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) in the PM10 emitted from burning the coals and briquettes, demonstrating that the REEs in both the coal-burning and briquette-burning PM10 are dominated by LREEs. The higher contents of total REEs and LREEs in the coal-burning PM10 are associated with the higher ash yields and lower volatile contents in the raw coals. A comparative analysis indicates that the La/Sm ratios in the PM10 emitted from burning the coals and briquettes, being lower than 2, are lower than those in the particles from gasoline-powered vehicle emission.},

   abstract = {Distribution of rare earth elements (REEs) in six speciations extracted from coal and coal gangue and their combustion products (slag and fly ash) generated by three different power plants in China were determined by sequential extraction procedure combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method. The results show that the REEs mainly occurred as acid soluble and silicate & aluminosilicate fraction, e.g., approximately 42.54% and 45.62% in coal gangue, 32.85% and 57.13% in lignite, and 18.10% and 75.46% in bituminous coal, respectively. However, REEs in the combustion products were mainly presented in silicate & aluminosilicate fraction regardless of coal or coal gangue, reaching up to approximately 80% of the total REEs content. During combustion, around 36%, 23%, and 5% from the other five fractions (water soluble, ion-exchangeable, acid soluble, organic, and sulfide) were transformed to silicate & aluminosilicate fraction from coal gangue, lignite, and bituminous coal, respectively. In the case of coal or coal gangue, the amount of each REEs in the same extracted fraction was different, but the distribution trend of REEs from La to Lu in each fraction was followed in the same rule. In the case of slag and fly ash generated from coal or coal gangue, distribution of REEs from La to Lu in each fraction showed the different trend between fly ash and slag. This was due to the fly ash exposed in flue gas system was much longer than the time for slag formation. Rare earth elements (REEs) contain yttrium, scandium, and 15 lanthanide elements. According to geochemical properties, REEs can be divided into light (LREEs-La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm), medium (MREEs-Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, and Y) and heavy (HREEs-Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) [1]. REEs have important applications in wind turbines, permanent magnets, photovoltaic films, catalysts, etc. [2,3]. With the rapid development of global economy, rare earth ore gradually reduced. Therefore, the European Commission [4] and the US Department of Energy [2] regarded REEs as important strategic resources [5] , and promote the study of extraction of REEs from non-rare earth raw materials. For example, Park et al [6] used engineering bacteria to recover REEs from low-level raw materials. Liang et al [7] extracted REEs from phosphors through alkaline fusion and acid leaching. Coal and coal ash were considered as potential secondary REEs raw materials [8-11]. In order to separate and enrich REEs from coal and coal ash, scholars have done a lot of research on the forms of occurrence of REEs in coal and coal ash. Some studies have shown that there was a positive correlation between REEs and ash content in coal [12-14]. Further studies have found that most REEs were presented in kaolinite, illite, gorceixite, and boehmite [15,16]. Other researchers also found that REEs in coal was mainly present in minerals such as carbonates and silicates, and a small amount of REEs was also presented in organic matter [17-19]. Zhang et al [20] found that most REEs in coal gangue was contained in amorphous minerals with low crystallinity, and most of the REEs can be extracted with 25% hydrochloric acid. After pulverized coal was burned, REEs were further enriched in its coal ash, and the forms of occurrence of REEs in coal ash was also a hot research topic in this field. REEs in coal ash was dispersed in the aluminosilicate glass phase [21-24] , phosphate minerals [25] , and carbonate minerals [26]. Montross et al [27] also found that REEs in coal ash were presented in monazite, xenotime, and apatite. The diversity of coal and coal gangue and their complex formation environment lead to differences in the occurrence forms of REEs. It is necessary to do more in-depth study on the occurrence forms of REEs during combustion of coal},

   abstract = {Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) have attracted considerable attention over the last decade because of their vital roles in clean energy, consumer product, national defense and security applications, among other uses. Due to the retention of REY during coal burning, coal combustion ash is considered as potential alternative sources for REY. Understanding the content, speciation, retention and/or transformation behavior of REY during coal combustion not only expands our knowledge of the combustion behavior of the trace elements in coal, but also provides basis for modeling REY partitioning during coal combustion and for developing economically viable REY recovery technologies. This review makes a critical summary of recent progress in the study of REY in coal ash. The contents and the extraction potentials of REY in coal ash derived from 15 major coal-producing countries worldwide were summarized and evaluated. Various analytical methods for determining REY bulk contents and speciation, together with the solid sample pretreatment, analytical accuracy and precision, advantages and disadvantages were summarized and compared. Modern analytical approaches combined indirect methods (e.g., sequential extraction) shed light on the physical distribution, mineralogy, and the chemical state of REY in coal ash. Three types of REY occurrences in coal ash, including Si-Al glassy association, discrete minerals or compounds, and organic association (bound with unburned carbon) were defined in the review. The glassy association can be further divided into REY minerals closely bound to glass phases and dispersed throughout the glassy structure. REY partitioning in various emission streams, the size distribution, and their enrichment behavior in coal ash were discussed. Thermal behavior and transformation of various REY forms in coal during combustion process, including organic-associated REY, REY phosphates, REY carbonates, clay-bound REY and among others were summarized. Two possible retention mechanisms of REY by aluminosilicate glass at boiler temperature were proposed: the incorporation of the individual REY phases into the glass as inclusions and the diffusion of REY phases throughout Si-Al glass structures in the melting process. Feed coal mineral types, mineral-mineral associations, boiler conditions, and other factors control the retention process. After coal combustion, the speciation of REY in fly ash may be modified by the reactions of REY phases with flue gas components. Further, an overview of REY transformation mechanisms during coal combustion was deeply discussed. Finally, current extraction techniques for REY recovery from coal combustion ash were introduced. Future outlooks and research problems were also identified.},

   abstract = {This study examined rare earth element (REE) trends for Illinois Basin coal-sourced fly ashes, with the goal of understanding the elemental composition and resource potential for various fly ash fractions. Illinois Basin coals have a high volatile C through A bituminous rank with a moderate ash content (slightly>12% ash (dry basis)), about 3% sulfur, and, in general, lower concentrations of hazardous and other trace elements than many Central Appalachian coals. Fly ash from the combustion of Illinois Basin coals tends to have a high Fe2O3 content owing to the amount of pyrite in the feed coals. The rare earth element (REE) concentrations in Illinois Basin coal-sourced fly ashes are less than that for fly ashes from the combustion of Central Appalachian coals. The Upper continental crust-corrected fly ashes show an H-type enrichment, a positive EuN/EuN*, and, in some cases, a sharp Gd peak. For comparison, a suite of fly ashes from the combustion of a blend of eastern Kentucky coals had an H-type enrichment, a positive EuN/EuN*, but only a minimal Gd peak. In contrast, fly ash from the combustion of the Fire Clay coal, a REE-rich coal, had a negative EuN/EuN* and a sharp Gd peak. These results highlight the importance of feed coal composition on trace element contents of respective combustion fly ash fractions and also the unique REE enrichment patterns of the Illinois Basin fly ashes relative to the better studied fly ashes of eastern Kentucky and Central Appalachia.},

   abstract = {Water draining from abandoned open-pit coal mines in southeastern Ohio typically has a low pH and high concentrations of Fe, Al and Mn, as well as of trace metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, etc.) and of the rare earth elements (REEs). The cations of different elements are sorbed selectively by Fe and Al hydroxide precipitates which form with increasing pH. As a result, the trace elements are separated from each other when the hydroxide precipitates are deposited in the channel of a flowing stream. Therefore, the low-energy environment of a stream contaminated by mine effluent is a favorable site for the chemical fractionation of the REEs and of other groups of elements with similar chemical properties. The interpretation of chemical analyses of water collected along a 30-km-stretch of Rush Creek near the town of New Lexington, Perry County, Ohio, indicates that the abundances of the REEs in the water appear to change downstream when they are normalized to the REE concentrations of the mine effluent. In addition, the Ce/La ratios (and those of all REEs) in the water decrease consistently downstream. The evidence indicates that the REEs which remain in solution are enriched La and Ce because the other REEs are sorbed more efficiently. The solid Fe(OH)3 precipitates in the channel of Rush Creek upstream of New Lexington also contain radioactive 226Ra that was sorbed from the water. This isotope of Ra is a decay product of 238U which occurs in the Middle Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) coal and in the associated shale of southeastern Ohio. The activity of 226Ra of the Fe(OH)3 precipitates increases with rising pH, but then declines farther downstream as the concentration of Ra remaining in the water decreases. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Miocene coal beds in the Siniy Utyes Basin, South Primirye, in eastern Russia, are interbedded with volcanic ash layers and are enriched in rare earth elements and Y (REY, or REE if Y is not included), Zr, redox-sensitive and other trace elements around these layers. However, high contents of fresh volcanic glass and alkalies as well as no evidence of leaching suggest that the source of these elevated concentrations of these elements are not interpreted to be derived from the volcanic ash fall layers, as is found in many other coals worldwide. In contrast, the broader geochemical signature of the coal indicates that these elements sourced from weathered granites. Interestingly, both the coal and volcanic ash contain pyrite and, less commonly, barite, REE phosphate (rhabdophane?), silver sulfate and sylvite, all of which indicate a post-depositional emplacement of these trace elements, possibly through an initial evaporative process in the peat before burial. Instead of leaching of the adjacent tuff, enrichment of REY, Zr, Mo, V, and other elements in the coal proximal to the volcanic ash layers may be a result of higher permeability and a geochemical barrier at the coal/volcanic ash interface, which concentrated element migration in these zones during diagenesis. U-Pb zircon dating (LA ICP-MS) of the volcanic ash layer indicates an age in the 18–25 Ma range. The younger (5 of 22 grains) cluster of dates, however, is in the 18–19 Ma (early Miocene) range, which may indicate the age of the actual eruption.},

The material has widely varying concentrations of some elements, such as Sn, which might reflect non-coal contamination of the product stream at any point from mining and beneficiation of the coal to disposal of the waste product. The rare earth elements have a strong M-type enrichment. Concentration of the rare earths is below what would normally be considered to be an economic grade. The mix of coal and REE-lean rock, though, implies that the resource must be examined with an eye towards the recovery of critical elements, not just for the reconnaissance bulk characterization, as was done here. Despite the low concentration of REE and other critical elements, factors such as the ease of moving the comminuted, near-surface material and its proximity to highway, rail, and river transport implies that such resources must be carefully examined; not simply dismissed because the grade is below a cutoff level developed for coal, not mixed rock + coal.},

Coal fly ash (CFA), as the main byproduct of coal combustion, enriches REEs in some areas of the world. In this paper, a two-stage hydrometallurgical process (alkali fusion-acid leaching) was developed to recover REEs from CFA. The CFA was firstly roasted at high temperature with Na 2 CO 3 addition, followed by the leaching step. The effects of parameters of the alkali fusion and acid leaching on REEs extraction were investigated. Results indicated that the two-stage method was more efficient compared with direct leaching method. Optimum conditions of alkali fusion were 1:1 (mass ratio of CFA/Na 2 CO 3 ), heating in 860 °C for 0.5 h. The 72.78% leaching REEs efficiency can be obtained in the optimal operation conditions: leaching time (2 h), stirring speed (400 rpm), the HCl concentration (3 mol/L) and the solid-liquid ratio (1/20). This study should be useful in developing a strong theoretical foundation and technological support for the enrichment and extraction of REEs.},

Rare earth elements (REE) are strategic resources and the recycling of REE in alternative resources is urgent and gets increasingly attention. However, the separation of REE in these alternative resources is still a challenge due to the low concentration of REE and multi coexisted ions in acidic system. In this study, the species distribution of REE within the pH 0 to 8.0 was calculated. The SBA-15 originated from coal fly ash was modified by two steps with (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPADA) to obtain DTPADA-SBA-15 adsorbent, which was applied to the selective adsorption of REE. The results showed that DTPADA-SBA-15 possessed excellent adsorption performance on the selective adsorption of REE, including Eu, Gd, Tb, Nd and Sm, in acidic solution (pH 2) with multi competing ions. The FT-IR and Zeta potential characterization verified that the chemical adsorption through the coordination of O in DTPADA-SBA-15 with REE was dominant at lower pH value. The study of adsorption kinetics indicated that the adsorption of rare earth metal ions followed pseudo-second-order kinetic, of which the adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm model.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a proof-of-concept study that determines elemental concentrations in the mineral matter of the high-ash, Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM), Bowen Basin, Queensland. Coal in the FCCM has good coking properties but has not been extensively explored owing to its high ash content. This study performs a preliminary assessment of the elements from the coal portion that would typically become waste after washing or combustion. Given that the needs for industrial extraction methods will change over time, cataloguing and documenting the elemental composition of coal may assist future development of multiple products for the benefit of both the coal and mineral industries. This preliminary study has revealed similar elevations of REE and higher-than-average crustal concentrations of lithium, bismuth and scandium in some of the samples. Further analyses will be required on a larger dataset to better understand elemental associations and explore spatial patterns of elemental content that may indicate localised enrichments. Understanding the potential of valuable elements in the FCCM may stimulate interest in multiple-product-coal (or elemental-coal) mining in this under-exploited resource and further encourage the reduction of waste from other Australian coals at the wash-plant stage.},

Research on rare earth elements (REEs) and unburned carbon removal by flotation from CFA is burgeoning, respectively. It will be beneficial if REEs could be rich in the flotation product with the carbon removal. In this study, the optimization of flotation for the unburned carbon removal was investigated and near 100% removal came true with loss on ignition of 56% and the yield of 7.7%. The optimal conditions contain rotation speed of 600 rpm and time of 30 min using the collector of 1200 g/t, the frother of 140 g/t, and the density of 130 g/t for the flotation. The majority of REEs occurred in the tailing after the flotation due to the low yield and REEs contents of the concentrates. The difference of REEs distribution in the tailing and concentrate is more significant in the milled sample. The morphology was also observed to explain the microscale behavior of REEs during the flotation.},

   abstract = {The majority of rare earth elements (REEs) in coal fly ash (CFA) are associated with the aluminosilicate glassy phase, hindering their solubility in the acid leaching process. In this study, a sequential chemical roasting, water leaching, and acid leaching process was developed for the recovery of REEs from CFA. The effect of several roasting additives on the transformation of CFA phases into water or acid soluble phases was first studied. The reaction conditions for chemical roasting were selected based on a thermodynamic analysis. The selected reaction conditions were then validated experimentally. NaOH and Na2CO3 were the most effective additives to break the glassy phases to sodium silicate and sodium aluminosilicate, which can then be readily dissolved in water or acid. The reactions with NaOH was found to be spontaneous at ambient temperatures, while the reactions with Na2CO3 were spontaneous at elevated temperatures. Water leaching was very effective for the dissolution of the sodium silicate product, removal of the majority of silica, and for turning the glassy phases into a porous structure. As a result, mass transfer limitations were reduced, and acid could easily diffuse into the particles, dissolve the majority of remaining, and extract REEs along with other elements such as Al. This process significantly enhanced the REE recovery to 79% and 89% using NaOH and Na2CO3 roasting, respectively, compared to 20% REE recovery in baseline acid leaching.},

   abstract = {A suite of 72 samples of Illinois Basin coal was collected from 2015 to 2018, from 14 active coal mining and preparation operations in Illinois and Indiana. The goals of the study were to investigate the behavior of trace elements during coal preparation and provide current coal quality data for active mining operations in the Illinois Basin, which has become one of the most important suppliers of U.S. coal. Samples include raw coal, cleaned coal, and waste (refuse) coal. The efficiency of cleaning is shown by reduction of ash yield, increase in heating values, and a pronounced shift in the proportion of sulfur forms. In most raw coals, pyritic sulfur (Py S) exceeds organic sulfur (Org S; Org S/Py S ≤ 1.0), whereas in prepared coals, organic sulfur is the predominant sulfur form (Org S/Py S ≥ 1.0). In waste (refuse) coals, Org S/Py S is substantially reduced, or almost entirely in the pyritic form (Org S/Py S near zero). Trends in the distribution of inorganically-associated lithophile and chalcophile elements are shown, as well those for elements having mixed organic-inorganic associations and those that are primarily organic-hosted. Lithophile elements, including Li, Al, P, Ti, Sc, Rb, Y, Zr, Nb, Cs, Ba, the lanthanides, Hf, Th, and U, are partitioned into waste coals with corresponding reduction in cleaned coals. At the same time, chalcophile elements hosted by pyrite, such as As, Sb, Hg, and Pb, are also partitioned into waste coals. Rare earth elements (REEs), including Sc, Y, and the lanthanides, are enriched in waste coals at levels that approximate their content in the upper continental crust (UCC). Several other critical elements, defined as mineral commodities deemed critical to the economy and security of the United States, including V, Cr, As, Rb, Sb, and Cs, show enrichment in waste coals, that may facilitate their co-extraction with the REEs. Concentrations for elements of environmental concern in cleaned coals are similar to or below those for world average coals with the exception of Pb in coals from Illinois. Laser-ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) for pyrite in a subset of 21 samples of raw and cleaned coal provided direct determinations of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi. LA-ICP-MS was used together with bulk sample pyritic sulfur and trace element concentrations to estimate the elemental proportion of bulk Cu, As, Hg, and Pb in pyrite, indicating that Hg and Pb are hosted almost entirely by pyrite, whereas the proportion of Cu and As in pyrite accounts for about half of the bulk content. With growing interest in recovering critical elements from coal, partitioning of a large range of elements into waste coals presents a possible opportunity, but also a potential hazard, due to enrichment in harmful elements such as Hg, As, and Pb.},

Several major oxides (notably CaO and SO3, but also including Fe2O3, MgO, K2O, and P2O5) and minor elements (Mn, As, Sr, Ba, and Pb) are depleted in the post-HNO3-extraction spent ash. The total lanthanides, Y, and Sc concentration is reduced by about 20% in the spent ash, with Gd showing the greatest decrease. Along with Gd, Nd and Dy are also well differentiated between the feed and spent ashes, with La and Sm showing minimal partitioning. The Gd decrease is correlated with the depletion of Fe2O3. The heavy rare earth elements (REE heavier than Eu) and Y are disproportionately concentrated in the HNO3-leachate compared to the light REE. For the ashes studied, Sc did not partition between the feed and spent ashes. Pozzolanicity tests show that the compressive strength and strength activity indices of the spent ash + ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mixes are comparable to 100% OPC, indicating that the spent ashes produced in the pilot-scale runs have the potential to be sold as a Class F fly ash. Ultimately, the beneficiated ash chemistry influences the chemistry of the post-HNO3-extraction spent ash and the HNO3-leachate. A 500-ppm-REE fly ash will presumably be a more economically favorable feedstock than an ash with a significantly lesser concentration.},

Assuming a coal production rate of 600 million short tons per year with an average REE content of 200 ppm, the potential REE resource is 120,000 tons per year, which is similar to the annual global production of REEs. Most of those resources that are associated with coal-related materials are found in association with the gangue or ash-based content from the coal ore. Under normal coal plant operation, the REEs often end up in refuse piles or tailings impoundments. In many cases, these REEs can be recovered at low cost using appropriate coal preparation, heap leaching, solvent extraction and/or selective precipitation, followed by subsequent separation and purification of individual REEs. In the present research, the processing approach uses a natural pyrite stream, which was removed during coal cleaning and used to enhance leaching. Bio-oxidation has been used commercially to accelerate leaching, and this approach has been applied to coal-based materials. The ferric ions generated from bio-oxidation oxidize sulfide minerals such as pyrite, which generates acid. Both acid and ferric ions are helpful for leaching REEs, as well as for removing residual sulfides, thereby preventing future acid mine drainage and related liabilities. It can be seen that, recovery of REEs from coal waste materials can enable coal producers to use untapped REEs resources to produce revenue and extend resource life while simultaneously reducing future environmental issues and costs.},

   abstract = {The ever increasing applications of rare earth elements and their limited primary resources has compelled researchers worldwide to find alternate methods of efficient leaching from various secondary resources, in particular from end of life products. The present research work describes such a process to extract rare earth elements from coal ash using low molecular weight carboxylic acids. Different carboxylic acids, i.e. monocarboxylic (lactic acid), dicarboxylic (malonic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid) and tricarboxylic acid (citric acid) were used to successfully leach out significant proportion of rare earth elements (up to 62%) from coal ash at the natural pH of the carboxylic acid solutions (pH 1.6–2.3). The carboxylic acid concentration, leaching duration, temperature, and pulp density were optimized for the leaching process. Best leaching efficiency (65% for LREE, 19% for HREE & 62% for total REE) was achieved using 5% tartaric acid solution having natural solution pH 1.8 at 90 °C with a leaching duration of 60 min. The leaching efficiency of the different carboxylic acids were in the order of tartaric acid>lactic acid>citric acid>malonic acid>succinic acid. The leaching kinetics of individual rare earth elements was found to be different from each other owing to their different complex formation ability with carboxylic acids. Appreciable selectivity was observed for leaching of rare earth elements over transition metal and main group elements. XRD and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) studies revealed that unlike mineral acids, carboxylic acids leached out rare earth elements without damaging the minerology of coal ash, thus providing the opportunity to utilize the treated coal ash for other applications like in cement and bricks industries. Thus, the novelty of the present work lies in efficient and selective leaching of lanthanides from coal ash using only organic acids, which are considered much milder and greener options compared to mineral acids.},

   abstract = {The aim of the experimental works presented in this paper was to develop a method using wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WDXRF) in order to determine the content of 16 rare earth elements (REEs) and the concentration of the said elements in 169 samples of combustion ash of coals coming from ten Polish coal mines, as well as to validate the method. It was found out that there is a clear diversity in the levels and ranges of the variability of REEs occurrence in coal ashes. The average content of cerium, lanthanum, and scandium amounts to 198.8 μg g-1, 76.5 μg g-1, and 52.4 μg g-1 respectively, whereas for such metals as europium, holmium, lutetium, terbium, and thulium, the average content does not exceed the level of 5 μg g-1 (the average content for these metals amounts to 1.2 μg g-1, 1.4 μg g-1, 0.3 μg g-1, 1.3 μg g-1, and 0.6 μg g-1, respectively). In addition, this paper presents an analysis of data obtained by means of hierarchical clustering analysis. Simultaneous interpretation of the dendrogram of objects (coal ash samples) and the color map of the experimental data allowed a more in-depth analysis of the relationships between the clustered coal ash samples from different coal mines and the content of the rare earth elements.},

   abstract = {Global demand for rare earth elements (REEs) has been on the rise due to recent rapid technological advancements. Even though most REEs are mainly recovered from rich ores and mineral deposits, recovery of REEs from secondary sources has attracted attention. However, low metal concentration, complex matrices and high levels of other impurities in mine wastes and tailings have remained the toughest challenges to overcome. The presence of low amount of valuable metals such as Sc requires utilization of very selective separation techniques such as ion exchange. A series of ion exchange resins (chelating, solvent impregnated and strongly acidic) were studied in the recovery of Sc from synthetic and actual pregnant leach solutions obtained from acid-leaching of coal fly ash. To the best of our knowledge, this paper exhibits the first attempt in selective recovery (from other REEs as well as major Fe and Al contaminations) of Sc in coal fly ash using ion exchange separation technique. With maximum capacity of ∼24 mg Sc/g resin, Sc was adsorbed quickly on phosphorus containing Lewatit® VP OC 1026 and TP 272 resins even in the presence of high levels of potentially interfering Fe3+ and Al3+ ions. Full elution of the adsorbed REEs from VP OC 1026 was achieved with 5 M H2SO4, with only minor Sc removal. While elution of Sc from these chelating resins has been reported to be challenging, Sc could be eluted almost completely with 2 M NH4F. Recovery of REEs with 5 M H2SO4 from TP 272 resulted in co-elution of only 7% of the adsorbed Sc while the rest could be eluted efficiently with 6 M HNO3.},

   abstract = {The rare earth elements (REE) possess a beneficial combination of chemical and physical properties, making them valuable for most advanced branches of engineering and technology. Alternative sources of REE are desirable due to limited reserves of conventional REE containing minerals over the world combined with disproportionate supply over demand in the commodity markets. This study investigated the occurrence of REE and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in Cretaceous Nigerian coals for prospective industrial applications. Results show that the coals’ crystalline mineral matter comprises quartz, kaolinite, and illite with minor quantities of feldspar, hematite, magnetite, calcite, dolomite, which indicate detrital mineral origins. Elemental relationships (such as Al2O3/TiO2, Cr/Th vs. Sc/Th, and Co/Th vs. La/Sc) suggest sediment-source regions with mafic, intermediate or felsic compositions. REE are either strongly fractionated or characterized by light-enrichment along with outlook coefficient (Coutl) values that suggest the coals are prospective substitute sources for REE and yttrium (REY) recovery. Several minerals including jarosite, goethite, epsomite, ferrohexahydrite, natrojarosite, rozenite, and gypsum were detected in trace amounts. REE mineral phases were not identified but only amorphous phases containing Ce, La, Nd, Th, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Hf. Maceral composition (high vitrinite), presence of iron-containing minerals (hematite and magnetite), high carbon contents, reduced volatile matter and low ash content favoured the formation of naturally occurring multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) structures in Maiganga (MGA) coal. Hence, the present study is the first scientific report on the naturally occurring REEs and MWC nanophases in Cretaceous coals from the Benue Trough.},

   abstract = {In previous studies, the authors found that the leaching recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from coal waste can be improved by calcination without adding any additives. Two potential mechanisms were proposed to explain the enhanced recovery: (1) decomposition of difficult-to-dissolve REE-bearing minerals into soluble forms; and (2) liberation of REE-bearing minerals encapsulated in clays after calcination due to the dehydration and disintegration of the layered clay structure. Unfortunately, no direct evidence was obtained to confirm the mechanisms. In the present study, the mineralogy of REEs existing in the leaching solid residue of raw and calcined coal wastes of the Western Kentucky No. 13 and Fire Clay seams was systematically characterized through scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis. Characterization results showed that crandallite-group minerals still existed in the leaching solid residue of the raw coal wastes but disappeared in the leaching solid residue of the calcined products. Therefore, calcination decomposed crandallite-group minerals into easy-to-leach forms and thereby enhanced the leaching recovery of REEs. Moreover, the numbers of REE-bearing particles (N) found per area under SEM were calculated. Larger N values were obtained from the leaching solid residue of the calcined coal wastes relative to the raw coal wastes and the leaching solid residue of the raw coal wastes. This phenomenon confirmed that calcination promoted the liberation of REE-bearing particles. Overall, findings from the present study confirmed the two mechanisms that explain the positive effect of calcination on the recovery of REEs from coal waste.},

   abstract = {The geochemistry of the REE (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, and Lu) is reviewed with supporting data from coals of North Asia. The 7189 samples from North Asia included in this study represent all coal ranks (lignites, subbituminous coals, bituminous coals and anthracites) as well as coals formed under different geotectonic regimes and in different sedimentary conditions. These coals are characterized by higher contents of the REE as compared to the coal Clarke. The distribution characteristics and accumulations of the REE have been studied in several coal deposits and basins. Within some basins with the near-background average contents of the REE isolated coal beds enriched in lanthanides have been observed. In coal basins and deposits the relative enrichment in the lanthanides are observed in the fields or zones adjacent to the source area of the terrigenous material. Accumulation of high REE contents in coal deposits can be attributed to the presence of rocks in the source area containing high concentrations of REE and also alkaline or acidic volcanic ash contemporaneous with the peat accumulation in the basin. Transformation of volcanic ashes under the aggressive hydro-environment of a peat bog results in the mobilization and redeposition of the REE adjacent to the altered volcanic ashes (tonsteins) with the formation of high concentrations of REE in the coal beds. The formation of the REE anomalies may also be related to hydrothermal processes. The modes of occurrence of the REE change during the coalification process. Brown coals with a low degree of coalification are dominated by the organic modes of occurrence of the REE, whereas in hard coals and anthracites authigenic mineral forms dominate.},

   abstract = {The pretreatment of middlings and coarse refuse material collected from a Pocahontas No.3 coal source using calcination was investigated for the potential of improving the leaching recovery of rare earth elements. Calcination at 600 °C significantly and preferentially improved light REE (LREE) recovery to values in the range of 80–90% using 1.2 M HCl. The positive effect was due to the increased pore diameter and volume as well as thermal decomposition of the minerals associated with the LREEs. Heavy REE recovery was not increased after calcination at 600 °C due to the need for higher temperatures to achieve thermal decomposition of HREE minerals. Furthermore, some HREEs were also associated with sulfide minerals (e.g., pyrite) which were transformed into low-solubility oxides (e.g., hematite) after roasting at 600 °C. Based on the leaching characteristics of the major elements (Fe, Al, Ca and Mg) and REEs along with SEM-EDX data, it was concluded that REEs in the two samples mainly occurred as phosphate minerals. In the middlings, some of the minerals were completely encapsulated by kaolinite, which was less apparent in the coarse refuse. In addition, it was found that a portion of the REEs (10–25%) in the samples were associated with the organic matter and micro-dispersed minerals in the organic matrix, was released after calcination and easily recovered using 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 solution at pH 5. Scandium primarily occurred in mineral forms with minimum amounts associated with ion-adsorbed clays and organic association.},

A total of 49 and 50 REE-bearing particles were found from the SEM-EDS specimens of the two materials, respectively. For both materials, light REEs were found in apatite, monazite, and crandallite-group minerals, while heavy REEs primarily existed in zircon and xenotime. Based on the number and REE contents of the REE-bearing particles, it was concluded that monazite, xenotime, and crandallite-group minerals were major contributors to the total REE contents in both materials. The number of crandallite-group mineral particles found from the Western Kentucky No. 13 material was more than that of monazite and xenotime particles. However, for the Fire Clay material, the number and size of crandallite-group mineral particles were close to those of monazite and xenotime particles. Since the monazite and xenotime particles contained more REEs relative to the crandallite-group mineral particles, it was inferred that the majority of the REEs, especially the light REEs, existing in the Fire Clay coal waste occurred as monazite and xenotime. In addition, comparing with the Western Kentucky No. 13 material, a larger portion of the heavy REEs in the Fire Clay material were comprised in zircon. SEM images of the REE-bearing particles indicated that both liberated particles and particles locked within dominant minerals (e.g., clays) existed in the two materials. A few of the particles found in the Western Kentucky No. 13 material were completely encapsulated within the dominant minerals. Findings from the current study will promote REE recovery from coal-related materials, particularly coal waste.},

   abstract = {Abundances, modes of occurrence, enrichment, and origin of critical elements in coal and coal-bearing sequences have attracted much attention in recent years. Previous investigations have attributed REE-Y-Nb-Ta-Zr-Hf mineralization in coals and in intra- and inter-seam tuffs in coal-bearing sequences to alkali volcanic ash eruptions and subsequent hydrothermal alteration. In this study, two major minable coal seams (D101 and W407) that are located in the lowermost and uppermost Wuchiapingian Longtan Formation in the Liupanshui Coalfield, Guizhou, southwestern China, were investigated in order to better understand the mechanism of REE-Y-Nb-Ta-Zr-Hf enrichment in these coals. Elevated concentrations of REE-Y-Nb-Ta-Zr-Hf in the D101 coal are dominantly due to the alkaline volcanic material forming the top of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP), which served as a terrigenous source region for the coal basin and to airborne volcanic ash, which occurs as an intra-seam tonstein within the coal seam. Both of the two source materials were subsequently subjected to groundwater leaching, resulting in redistribution of the rare earth elements and Y (REY), leading to an uneven distribution of REY and Zr along the studied coal-seam sections. The average REY oxides in the D101 and W407 coals are 2682 and 1260 ppm (both on ash basis), respectively, and the outlook coefficients are 0.79 and 1.15 respectively, indicating that both ashes from the two coals are potential raw sources for REY.},

The studied samples were taken from the BYJ, BYL, 48P open-pit mine panels and Ömerler and İğdekuzu underground mines. In order to observe the mineral and REE element distributions along the coal seam profile, samples were taken by using channel sampling method from the BYJ, BYL and 48P open-pit mine panels. On the other hand, representative samples which represent the whole coal seam including partings and clayey layers were taken from the same open-pit mine panels, İğdekuzu and Ömerler undergroud mines to investigate the REE distributions in the coalfield. The proximate, ICP-OES, XRF, SEM and XRD analyses were performed on the samples. Quartz, kaolinite and dolomite are the most abundant minerals in the samples. Smectite, mica, illite, pyrite and siderite are the second common minerals. In a few samples, alkali feldspar, chlorite, gypsum, jarosite, magnetite, feldspar, vermiculite and zeolite minerals are identified. In addition, monazite, florencite, baryte and thorite were detected in minor amounts using SEM analyses. The most abundant major oxides are SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, CaO and SO3 respectively. The K2O, MnO, Na2O, P2O5 and TiO2 major oxides are occur in lesser amounts. Kaolinite and quartz minerals might be the main sources of Al2O3 and SiO2 in the samples. The MgO, CaO, Fe2O3 and SO3 major oxides can be derived from mainly dolomite, siderite, feldspar, smectite, montmorillonite, serpentine and pyrite. The P2O5 and TiO2 are derived from the apatite, monazite, florencite, clay and mica minerals. The La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Tm and Lu elements in the samples have higher concentrations than the World brown coal averages. The total REY and LREY concentrations show similar distributions and reach high values at the south of the coal basin. However, the HREY and MREY concentrations are high at the Ömerler underground mine. The coal layers show HREY enrichment whereas the clayey coal and clayey layers indicate LREY type enrichment. The Ce, Eu, La, Nd and Sm elements are associated with the clay and phosphate minerals. Moreover, the Dy, Er, Gd, Ho, Lu, Pr, Tb, Tm and Yb are related to the pyrite, siderite and dolomite. The REY concentration in the Tunçbilek Basin is probably related to the terrigenous, tuffaceous and hydrothermal types of accumulations. The total REY concentration of the samples is below the cut-off grade (1000 μg/g) although the concentration coefficients of the Tunçbilek coal samples indicate slight enrichment. Based on the relation between cut-off grade and Coutl values, the Tunçbilek coal cannot be a potential source of REY.},

In this study, 186 coal samples, 11 intrusion-affected coal samples, 4 samples representative of the intrusive rocks, one coal roof and one parting samples were collected from 29 boreholes at the Zhuji coal mine, Huainan Coalfield, Anhui Province, China. The main objective is to characterize the intrusive rocks in the coal-bearing sequence and to investigate the correlation of REE parameters in the coals with the source rocks, depositional environment, localized faults, igneous intrusions, and thickness of the coal beds. A sequence (from base to top) of acidic to basic intrusive rocks through the coal-bearing strata was identified, which possibly corresponds to different intrusive episodes of granite, diorite/monzonite and gabbro. Both the REE contents and degree of fractionation of light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE) increase from acidic to basic rocks. Most rocks are slightly depleted in Ce but highly depleted in Eu. The REE concentrations in coals from the Zhuiji mine (average of 118. μg/g) are nearly identical to recently-updated average Chinese values, but significantly higher than global values. The REE content of the intrusion-affected coals is not distinctively different from that of the other coals (P. =. 0.2), and REE concentrations of the igneous rocks appear to have no clear relationship to those of the intrusion-affected coals. The depositional environment and source rocks are presumably the main REE contributors to the coal-accumulation basin. The REE content in coals from fault-affected boreholes is higher than that in other boreholes and this trend is stronger in the coal seams of the upper strata. The HREE tend to be incorporated into thinner coal seams and the degree of fractionation between LREE and HREE of the coal-forming materials increases with coal thickness. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to discuss the relationship between Au, Ga in coal and in coal ash, the contents of Au and Ga in 815 °C coal ash were also determined by INAA and partial Ga by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The analysis results showed that: (1) the average contents of Au and Ga in upper Permian coal from Guizhou are 6.92 ng/g and 10.65 μg/g, respectively, far higher than that in Chinese coal and world coal; the average contents of Au (59.73 ng/g) and Ga (19.16 μg/g) in partings, roof and floor are higher than that in the coal and the Clarke value of sedimentary rock (especially for Au); (2) during the coal ashing process, Ga is enriched in the residues more easily than Au, which is mainly because of the difference in the mode of occurrence of the two elements. Gallium mainly occurs as the substitute of Al in the form of isomorph, which makes it hard to volatize; while Au shows a high association with organic matter, sulfide, and carbonates, and some may be nano-gold, which is easily volatile during coal combustion. Only Au occurred in the aluminosilicate is easily left in the residues; (3) we collected data on the Au and Ga contents in coal and coal ash from China and then conducted correlation analysis by combining data from coals and coal ashes worldwide; the cut-off grades of Au and Ga in coal are considered to be 200 ng/g and 60 μg/g, respectively.

However, by-products such as coal fly ash (CFA), coal bottom ash (CBA), and boiler slag are generated during coal combustion, and have become a significant environmental concern. There is an urgent need for transdisciplinary efforts in research, policy, and practice to reduce these by-products substantially. Many studies have focused on the environmental management and comprehensive utilization of CFA. As a comparison, less attention has been paid to CBA. Therefore, this critical review provides a holistic picture of CBA, from the generation, fundamental characteristics, environmental concerns to potential applications, and benefits analysis. Based on the fundamental characteristics, CBA can be considered as a sustainable and renewable resource with great potential to produce value-added materials. High-value applications and current research related to CBA, including construction and ceramic industry, wastewater remediation, soil amelioration, energy catalysis, valuable metals recovery, and material synthesis, are systemically presented and compared. It emphasizes the environmental and economic benefits of the sustainable applications of CBA as well. Particularly, it indicates that CBA is a promising candidate in normal, lightweight, self-compacting, and ultra-high-performance concrete, which shows a reduction in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions during concrete production. This work provides new insights into the greener and sustainable applications of CBA, and it will offer a practical guide for the sustainable development of the coal industry.},

   abstract = {Lithium is an important energy metal. Its concentrations in coals have been studied by many geologists. Its average content is only 14 mg/kg in the coals of the world. Lithium has never been reported as a coal associated deposit before. In order to study the concentrations in Chinese coals, 159 coal and gangue samples were taken from six coal mines and were determined by ICP-MS and the minerals in the samples were identified by X-ray powder diffraction. The results indicate that the Li contents in the coal samples from the Antaibao Coal Mine have reached the industry grade of coal associated deposits. In Tongxing Coal Mine, Li contents in the coal floor rock samples have reached the industry grade of independent lithium deposits. Main minerals are polylithionite, triphylite, zinnwaldite, lithionite and cookeite, which were transported into the peats. Therefore, lithium enriched most likely in the synsedimentary stage in both coal mines. Furthermore, a revised average Li content in Chinese coals was given.},

   abstract = {Coals are a major source of pollution in certain parts of the world due to mining, coal combustion, and disposal of fly ash. The recovery of valuable rare metals from coals or coal-processing byproducts is a promising way to utilise these traditional resources economically, efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way. Lithium, a highly interesting metal, has been found dispersed and even anomalously enriched in coal deposits, and is potentially extractable. This paper presents a review of geochemical investigations on Li-bearing coal and the technical development of Li extraction from coal. Based on available literature, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma as an excitation source (ICP-AES) are regarded as the preferred methods of measuring Li concentration in coal and coal ash. Anomalous Li accumulations have been reported in coal deposits, especially in China. The limited studies on Li modes of occurrence and origins are discussed, and Li is shown to have an affinity mainly for clay minerals in coal, although further investigations are needed. Lithium is also found to be enriched in fly and bottom ashes during coal combustion. Finally, two successful Li recovery techniques from coal ash are presented.},

abstract = {Australia is experiencing a rapid escalation in exploration for, and extraction and processing of, critical minerals. This new boom is driven by changing geopolitics and global demand for low carbon technologies. This is arguably the biggest economic opportunity since the mining boom of the 2000s, driving the biggest transformation of the extractive industries in Australia since the development of offshore gas in the 1970s. Against this backdrop, Australian governments at all levels are implementing strategies to upgrade the domestic extraction and processing of critical minerals. In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of 17 strategies specifically targeting critical minerals – or the cognate categories of ‘strategic raw materials’ and ‘high-tech metals’. Based on a close reading and comparison of these strategies, the analysis finds far more commonalities than differences. Together they chart an approach typified by the facilitation of trade and investment, efforts to de-risk individual projects, and the streamlining of investment through regional hubs with common-infrastructure and planning. At the same time, they also exhibit concerning similarities in terms of the limited attention paid to improving environmental and social regulation or First Nations’ rights. Instead, ‘ESG’ is presented as a competitive advantage in global markets. This analysis is significant in identifying an emerging Australian mode of ‘green developmentalism’ that, while committing significant public funds to developing the mineral processing industry in the context of decarbonisation, keeps private capital firmly in the centre of its vision. This contrasts with more extensively studied modes of green developmentalism in other resource-rich countries.},

journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
abstract = {To avoid catastrophic climate change, the world is promoting a fast and unprecedented transition from fuels to renewables. However, the infrastructures of renewables, such as wind turbines and solar cells, rely heavily on critical minerals like rare earths, indium, etc. Such interactions between climate targets, energy transitions, and critical minerals were widely overlooked in the present climate scenario analysis. This study aims to fill this gap through an introduction of metal–energy–climate nexus framework with its application on global energy transition towards a carbon-neutral (or below 1.5 °C) target, in which six state-of-the-art integrated assessment models (IAMs) under different shared socioeconomic pathways were applied. Our analysis revealed that climate mitigation is expected to boost significantly the critical mineral demand by 2.6–267-fold, which varies greatly by IAM models. Solar power development may be constrained by tellurium (Te) and selenium (Se) shortage, while wind power will be jeopardized by the limited scalability of rare earth production. Moreover, a more sustainable pathway may come at higher demand for critical minerals along with higher renewable ratios. Consequently, a holistic investigation of the interaction of mineral, energy, and climate systems is highly recommended for future scenario designing.},

This renders the countries susceptible to supply chain disruption and urges them to develop alternative sources to compete in technological advancements. Among many proven newly identified sources, coal and coal-based materials present their opportunities. Due to the complex structure of coal, many mineral forms can be found in coal-related sources, including critical element-containing minerals. Among the fifty critical elements and minerals defined by the USGS, the rare earth elements, cobalt, lithium, and manganese, are particularly significant as they have enormous importance in high-technology product development. These critical metals can be found in high concentrations in coal-derived sources, such as coal refuse, coal combustion products, and coal acid mine drainage, and be recovered through various separation techniques. This study aims to advance the understanding of these elements' extraction and commercial potential from coal and coal-related sources and help address the world's challenges in the critical mineral supply chain. The concentrations and occurrences of these four commodities in coal-related sources were first reviewed. Later, their recovery processes were discussed, and a conceptual process flowsheet was proposed to selectively recover the rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and manganese from coal-based sources.},

In addition to the traditional lithium resources, lithium resources in coal seams have great potential in industrial application. Therefore, how to develop and utilize them is strategically significant for guaranteeing supply of lithium resources in China and promoting clean energy transformation. This paper summarizes the metallogenic ages, occurrence, enrichment factors, availability of lithium resources in coal seams in China. Conclusion are obtained as follows. i. coal-hosted lithium deposits discovered in China so far mainly occur in the Carboniferous-Permian strata of North China. They are less concentrated in smaller range in the Permian strata of Qilian-Qinling. ii. In China, coal-hosted lithium is mainly enriched in aluminum-bearing minerals. Lithium in coal seams mainly occurs in the inorganic matter, and some occurs in the organic matter. iii. Lithium enrichment in coal seams is caused by stable supply of aluminum and lithium-bearing minerals and special structural and geological factors. iv. According to China’s national standards on grades of lithium content in coal seams, the metallogenic belts of lithium in coal seams at the southern foothill of Yin Shan and in Qilian-Qinling have the potential of lithium development and extraction, covering Junger mining area in Inner Mongolia, and Pingshuo and Ningwu mining areas in Shanxi.</p>}

abstractNote = {Recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from coal-related resources has recently received significant interest due to supply concerns and their key roles in critical industries and defense-related technologies. In this study, an integrated flowsheet consisting of sorting, crushing/grinding, physical separation, acid leaching, solvent extraction, and selective precipitation was designed to achieve continuous production of rare earth products from various coal-related resources such as coarse refuse and acid mine drainage. A pilot plant was constructed that enabled continuous testing of the circuitry on a range of different coal-based feedstocks. Despite achieving significant success in producing high-grade rare earth oxide products, low REE recovery values and high operational costs necessitated a re-evaluation of the process flowsheet. This article describes the circuitry improvements that were based on both laboratory and pilot plant test results. Roasting as a pre-leach treatment was found to significantly improve the leaching rate and overall REE recovery values. After roasting West Kentucky No. 13 and Fire Clay coal refuse materials at 600 °C, REE recovery increased by 60 and 40 absolute percentage points, respectively. Rare earth concentration in the pregnant leachate solution (PLS) was increased to around 700 ppm prior to solvent extraction using a staged precipitation method. REEs in the precipitate were re-dissolved, purified, and extracted from the PLS using solvent extraction and selective precipitation to values of around 80%. As a result of the improvements, chemical consumption in the acid leaching and solvent extraction processes was significantly reduced. A techno-economical assessment of the improved flowsheet indicated significant commercialization potential.},

The resulting microplasma contains excited molecular and atomic species from the bulk sample, as well as ablated particulates. These excited-state species emit light at unique wavelengths. This light can then be collected with a spectrometer and parsed to a computer. Since each element has a unique emission spectrum, all elements can be detected with LIBS. LIBS requires little or no sample preparation and can be performed remotely and in real time.

These would include sensitivity and speed of analyses, cost savings from automated laboratory systems, and use of computerized modeling approaches to digest large and complex data sets to provide needed answers in a timely manner. The latter is of particular importance in emergency exposure situations. From a strictly scientific perspective the integration of sound analytical chemical data with molecular biomarker data provides an essential linkage between chemical/drug dosages and eventual health outcomes. Subsequent chapters of this book will go into further detail regarding relationships between chemical analytical data and the various major classes of “omic” molecular biomarkers. The overall integration of these various types of data sets via computational modeling approaches across different levels of biological organization as noted in Chapter 1 will be discussed in terms of improved human health risk assessments.}

ABSTRACT = {The use of analytical techniques is important and critical in all areas related to REE, such as basic fundamental research, exploration, mining, extraction, and metallurgical activities at different stages by different industries. At every stage of these activities, rock, ore, minerals, and other related materials have to be analyzed for their REE contents in terms of elemental, isotopic, and mineralogical concentrations using different analytical techniques. Spectacular developments have taken place in the area of analytical instrumentation during the last four decades, with some of them having shrunk in size and become handheld. Among laboratory-based techniques, F-AAS, GF-AAS, ICP-OES, and MP-AES have become very popular. Because of high sensitivity, fewer interference effects, and ease of use, ICP-MS techniques, such as quadrupole ICP-MS, ICP-MS/MS, ICP-TOF-MS, MH-ICP-MS, HR-ICP-MS, and MC-ICP-MS, with both solution nebulization as well as direct solid analysis using laser ablation sample introduction methods, have become more popular for REE analysis. For direct analysis of solids, INAA, XRF, and LIBS techniques, as well as LA-based ICP-MS techniques, are being extensively utilized. The LIBS technique in particular requires little to no sample preparation. TIMS, SIMS, and SHRIMP techniques are being used for isotopic as well as dating REE depots. Portable analytical techniques, such as pXRF, pLIBS, and Raman spectrometers are able to perform in situ analysis even in the field, helping to make fast decisions during exploration studies. At present, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques including handheld, drone, and satellite-based techniques have become very popular in REE exploration studies because of their ability to cover larger areas in a limited time and, thus, became very cost-effective. Deployment of microanalytical devices/sensors mounted in remotely operated vehicles (ROV) is being successfully utilized in detecting REE-rich deposits in the deep oceans. Providing updated in-depth information on all these important aspects with suitable examples, especially from the point of view of REE research studies is the focal point of this review article.},

abstract = {Critical elements in coals and host rocks have attracted much attention due to their growing demand and rising economic significance. This research reports new data of elevated critical elements and mineralogical characteristics of the coals and host rocks from the Daping Mine, Yudongnan Coalfield, neighboring to the previously reported coal-hosted Li and rare earth elements plus yittrium (REY) ore deposit of the Donggou Mine in the same coalfield. The coal in the Daping Mine is mainly a medium-volatile bituminous coal and characterized by a low-ash yield (Ad = 13.08–30.32%, 19.65% on average) and a high-sulfur content (1.75–9.25%, 3.43% on average). Critical elements including Li, Ga, Nb, Ta, REY are enriched in the coal. Minerals in the Daping coal are mainly clay minerals (including illite, mixed layer of illite/smectite (I/S), kaolinite, and chamosite) and pyrite, and to a lesser extent, calcite, anatase, and marcasite, with traces of zircon, celestite, and baddeleyite. Lithium is mainly associated with illite, and Ga, Nb, Ta, and REY also have an inorganic affinity. The terrigenous materials of the Daping coal were from the intermediate-felsic rocks at the top of the Kangdian Upland rather than the basalts. Hydrothermal solutions also make a great contribution to the enrichment of critical elements and minerals. High-temperature solutions (>200 °C) may be responsible for the weakly negative Eu anomalies. The coal ashes in the Daping Mine have significant concentrations of Li2O (2583 ppm on average), Ga (83.5 ppm on average), (Nb, Ta)2O5 (143 ppm on average), and REO (oxides of REY, 1125 ppm on average), all of which are higher than their respective cut-off grades. Moreover, the floor strata are enriched in these critical elements. Thus, the coal ashes and floor strata are potential resources for extraction of these critical elements.}

abstract = {This study provides data on the occurrence and distribution of rare earth elements, yttrium, and scandium (REY + Sc) in coals and non-coal lithologies associated with coals from various Colombian coalfields. A number of authors have characterized the REY + Sc content of various international coal deposits; however, no study to date has specifically addressed the REY + Sc content of Colombian coals, despite Colombia's prominence as a global coal producer. In this study, 24 samples were collected from seven coalfields and subjected to REY + Sc analysis, density fractionation, and modified release tests. Overall, the Colombian coals analyzed in this study have an average REY + Sc abundance of 45 ppm on a dry whole coal basis (459 ppm on a dry ash basis) whereas the non-coal lithologies have an average REY + Sc content of 222 ppm. In particular, materials collected from the Antioquia-Viejo Caldas coalfield were found to contain a relatively higher amount of REY + Sc (>100 ppm) relative to the rest of the samples, which may be attributed to the volcaniclastic character of the sediment associated with the seams. Moreover, test results from the density fractionation and modified release tests show that the inorganic constituents are the major hosts of REY + Sc in Colombian coals, which is reflected by a strong and positive linear relationship existing between REY + Sc and sample ash yields.}
