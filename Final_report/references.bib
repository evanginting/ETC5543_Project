abstract = {Australia is experiencing a rapid escalation in exploration for, and extraction and processing of, critical minerals. This new boom is driven by changing geopolitics and global demand for low carbon technologies. This is arguably the biggest economic opportunity since the mining boom of the 2000s, driving the biggest transformation of the extractive industries in Australia since the development of offshore gas in the 1970s. Against this backdrop, Australian governments at all levels are implementing strategies to upgrade the domestic extraction and processing of critical minerals. In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis of 17 strategies specifically targeting critical minerals – or the cognate categories of ‘strategic raw materials’ and ‘high-tech metals’. Based on a close reading and comparison of these strategies, the analysis finds far more commonalities than differences. Together they chart an approach typified by the facilitation of trade and investment, efforts to de-risk individual projects, and the streamlining of investment through regional hubs with common-infrastructure and planning. At the same time, they also exhibit concerning similarities in terms of the limited attention paid to improving environmental and social regulation or First Nations’ rights. Instead, ‘ESG’ is presented as a competitive advantage in global markets. This analysis is significant in identifying an emerging Australian mode of ‘green developmentalism’ that, while committing significant public funds to developing the mineral processing industry in the context of decarbonisation, keeps private capital firmly in the centre of its vision. This contrasts with more extensively studied modes of green developmentalism in other resource-rich countries.},

Based on an analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey and other U.S. Government agencies, using multiple criteria, 35 minerals or mineral material groups have been identified that are currently (February 2018) considered critical. These include the following: aluminum (bauxite), antimony, arsenic, barite, beryllium, bismuth, cesium, chromium, cobalt, fluorspar, gallium, germanium, graphite (natural), hafnium, helium, indium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, niobium, platinum group metals, potash, rare earth elements group, rhenium, rubidium, scandium, strontium, tantalum, tellurium, tin, titanium, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, and zirconium. The categorization of minerals as critical may change during the course of the review process and is thus provisional.},

abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical materials and provide significant values to national security, energy production, environmental protection and economic growth. The supply of REEs in U.S. solely relies on import as domestic production of REEs was ceased because of the environmental concerns during mining and lack of competitiveness. Nonetheless, unconventional REEs-containing resources, including produced water, acid mine drainage, and coal and coal byproducts (C&CBs) contain significant amounts of REEs. However, the concentrations of REEs in these resources are several orders of magnitude lower than that of REEs ores. Thus, extraction of REEs from these materials is challenging. Here we report REEs extraction with environmentally friendly method that successfully concentrated REEs from 312 ppm in fly ash to 99.4\% in the final product. Especially, the five critically important REEs (Dy, Eu, Nd, Tb, and Y) account for up to ∼63\% of the total weight of all REEs in the final 99.4\%-purity product. Coal fly ash is one of the major solid coal utilization byproducts, representing great potential resources for REEs extraction. Extraction of REEs from these unconventional resources could be the way to secure domestic supply of these critical materials.},

journal = {Environmental Research Letters},
abstract = {To avoid catastrophic climate change, the world is promoting a fast and unprecedented transition from fuels to renewables. However, the infrastructures of renewables, such as wind turbines and solar cells, rely heavily on critical minerals like rare earths, indium, etc. Such interactions between climate targets, energy transitions, and critical minerals were widely overlooked in the present climate scenario analysis. This study aims to fill this gap through an introduction of metal–energy–climate nexus framework with its application on global energy transition towards a carbon-neutral (or below 1.5 °C) target, in which six state-of-the-art integrated assessment models (IAMs) under different shared socioeconomic pathways were applied. Our analysis revealed that climate mitigation is expected to boost significantly the critical mineral demand by 2.6–267-fold, which varies greatly by IAM models. Solar power development may be constrained by tellurium (Te) and selenium (Se) shortage, while wind power will be jeopardized by the limited scalability of rare earth production. Moreover, a more sustainable pathway may come at higher demand for critical minerals along with higher renewable ratios. Consequently, a holistic investigation of the interaction of mineral, energy, and climate systems is highly recommended for future scenario designing.},

The global dependency on China for raw materials (particularly rare earth elements) is a contentious issue, as China imposes a number of restrictions on the export of these minerals. This study uses the case of rare earth elements to evaluate Chinese export restrictions, reviewing China's current monopoly over the industry and providing insights on how widely traded these minerals are and China's position in international trade in terms of both volume and value. The study investigates the various trade restrictions imposed by China and their implications, including the availability of materials to industrialized countries.},

   abstract = {Mineral matter in coals has been found to host valuable elements including germanium, lithium and rare-earth elements (REE), but such content of Australian coals remains under-explored. The aim of this paper is to provide a proof-of-concept study that determines elemental concentrations in the mineral matter of the high-ash, Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM), Bowen Basin, Queensland. Coal in the FCCM has good coking properties but has not been extensively explored owing to its high ash content. This study performs a preliminary assessment of the elements from the coal portion that would typically become waste after washing or combustion. Given that the needs for industrial extraction methods will change over time, cataloguing and documenting the elemental composition of coal may assist future development of multiple products for the benefit of both the coal and mineral industries. This preliminary study has revealed similar elevations of REE and higher-than-average crustal concentrations of lithium, bismuth and scandium in some of the samples. Further analyses will be required on a larger dataset to better understand elemental associations and explore spatial patterns of elemental content that may indicate localised enrichments. Understanding the potential of valuable elements in the FCCM may stimulate interest in multiple-product-coal (or elemental-coal) mining in this under-exploited resource and further encourage the reduction of waste from other Australian coals at the wash-plant stage.},

Furthermore, the hydrometallurgical leaching of REEs from coal and coal discard is reviewed and a summary of recent outcomes on REEs recovery from the coal source is presented. The review validated the technical feasibility of the physical beneficiation of REE minerals from coal without a significant particle size reduction to produce high-grade REE feedstocks for leaching. Although ultrafine milling results in higher REE recovery values, additional milling costs may affect the viability of the process. Overall, the study confirms the abundance of REEs in coal, identifies gaps in knowledge, and highlighs future research that must be addressed to advance REEs recovery from these sources.},

This renders the countries susceptible to supply chain disruption and urges them to develop alternative sources to compete in technological advancements. Among many proven newly identified sources, coal and coal-based materials present their opportunities. Due to the complex structure of coal, many mineral forms can be found in coal-related sources, including critical element-containing minerals. Among the fifty critical elements and minerals defined by the USGS, the rare earth elements, cobalt, lithium, and manganese, are particularly significant as they have enormous importance in high-technology product development. These critical metals can be found in high concentrations in coal-derived sources, such as coal refuse, coal combustion products, and coal acid mine drainage, and be recovered through various separation techniques. This study aims to advance the understanding of these elements' extraction and commercial potential from coal and coal-related sources and help address the world's challenges in the critical mineral supply chain. The concentrations and occurrences of these four commodities in coal-related sources were first reviewed. Later, their recovery processes were discussed, and a conceptual process flowsheet was proposed to selectively recover the rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and manganese from coal-based sources.},

abstractNote = {Recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from coal-related resources has recently received significant interest due to supply concerns and their key roles in critical industries and defense-related technologies. In this study, an integrated flowsheet consisting of sorting, crushing/grinding, physical separation, acid leaching, solvent extraction, and selective precipitation was designed to achieve continuous production of rare earth products from various coal-related resources such as coarse refuse and acid mine drainage. A pilot plant was constructed that enabled continuous testing of the circuitry on a range of different coal-based feedstocks. Despite achieving significant success in producing high-grade rare earth oxide products, low REE recovery values and high operational costs necessitated a re-evaluation of the process flowsheet. This article describes the circuitry improvements that were based on both laboratory and pilot plant test results. Roasting as a pre-leach treatment was found to significantly improve the leaching rate and overall REE recovery values. After roasting West Kentucky No. 13 and Fire Clay coal refuse materials at 600 °C, REE recovery increased by 60 and 40 absolute percentage points, respectively. Rare earth concentration in the pregnant leachate solution (PLS) was increased to around 700 ppm prior to solvent extraction using a staged precipitation method. REEs in the precipitate were re-dissolved, purified, and extracted from the PLS using solvent extraction and selective precipitation to values of around 80\%. As a result of the improvements, chemical consumption in the acid leaching and solvent extraction processes was significantly reduced. A techno-economical assessment of the improved flowsheet indicated significant commercialization potential.},

The recovery of valuable rare metals from coals or coal-processing byproducts is a promising way to utilise these traditional resources economically, efficiently and in an environmentally friendly way. Lithium, a highly interesting metal, has been found dispersed and even anomalously enriched in coal deposits, and is potentially extractable. This paper presents a review of geochemical investigations on Li-bearing coal and the technical development of Li extraction from coal. Based on available literature, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma as an excitation source (ICP-AES) are regarded as the preferred methods of measuring Li concentration in coal and coal ash. Anomalous Li accumulations have been reported in coal deposits, especially in China. The limited studies on Li modes of occurrence and origins are discussed, and Li is shown to have an affinity mainly for clay minerals in coal, although further investigations are needed. Lithium is also found to be enriched in fly and bottom ashes during coal combustion. Finally, two successful Li recovery techniques from coal ash are presented.},

In addition to the traditional lithium resources, lithium resources in coal seams have great potential in industrial application. Therefore, how to develop and utilize them is strategically significant for guaranteeing supply of lithium resources in China and promoting clean energy transformation. This paper summarizes the metallogenic ages, occurrence, enrichment factors, availability of lithium resources in coal seams in China. Conclusion are obtained as follows. i. coal-hosted lithium deposits discovered in China so far mainly occur in the Carboniferous-Permian strata of North China. They are less concentrated in smaller range in the Permian strata of Qilian-Qinling. ii. In China, coal-hosted lithium is mainly enriched in aluminum-bearing minerals. Lithium in coal seams mainly occurs in the inorganic matter, and some occurs in the organic matter. iii. Lithium enrichment in coal seams is caused by stable supply of aluminum and lithium-bearing minerals and special structural and geological factors. iv. According to China’s national standards on grades of lithium content in coal seams, the metallogenic belts of lithium in coal seams at the southern foothill of Yin Shan and in Qilian-Qinling have the potential of lithium development and extraction, covering Junger mining area in Inner Mongolia, and Pingshuo and Ningwu mining areas in Shanxi.</p>}

   abstract = {This paper discusses the modes of occurrence of critical elements and their origins in the studied coal and associated rock samples (partings and roof strata) from the Datanhao coal mine, Daqingshan Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, northern China. The studied coals are enriched in trace elements including Zr, Hf, Th, Be, F, Zn, Ga, Nb, Mo, Cd, In, Sn, Ta, Hg, W, Pb, and rare earth elements and Y (REY). Zirconium, Nb, Ta, and Hf are largely associated with anatase in the studied coal and non-coal samples. The main carriers of REY, Th, and U in both coal and non-coal samples are Ca-bearing REE-phosphate minerals, most likely monazite, although U is partly associated with organic matter. Fluorine in the Datanhao coals is mainly associated with kaolinite. Most partings identified as volcanic ash-derived tonsteins from the Datanhao Mine exhibit negative Eu anomalies that, along with the common presence of equant-shaped euhedral volcanic quartz (beta-quartz), indicate a felsic volcanic source located in the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt. Other probable sources of clastic material into the basin include the pre-Cambrian granites from the adjacent uplands, which may be responsible for the light rare earth element enrichment of the studied deposits, and associated metamorphic rocks from the adjacent uplands. Owing to acidic hydrothermal fluids, which are most likely related to the Yanshanian (Jurassic to Early Cretaceous) intrusive activity and/or low-temperature basinal waters circulating within the coal-bearing unit during the epigenetic stage, most of the coal benches from the Datanhao mine are also relatively enriched in middle rare earth elements. On the other hand, some coal and non-coal bench samples from the middle Datanhao section are enriched in heavy REE. This, along with the presence of abundant syngenetic or early diagenetic carbonate minerals, indicates deposition in an episodic alkaline environment, the origin of which is mostly probably attributed to evaporation and/or saline water inputs resembling a playa lake environment. As the concentrations of Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta are all close to or higher than the respective industry cut-off grades or standards for these critical elements, the Datanhao coal seam has potential economic significance for these as an important by-product of the coal mining.},

abstract = {Critical elements in coals and host rocks have attracted much attention due to their growing demand and rising economic significance. This research reports new data of elevated critical elements and mineralogical characteristics of the coals and host rocks from the Daping Mine, Yudongnan Coalfield, neighboring to the previously reported coal-hosted Li and rare earth elements plus yittrium (REY) ore deposit of the Donggou Mine in the same coalfield. The coal in the Daping Mine is mainly a medium-volatile bituminous coal and characterized by a low-ash yield (Ad = 13.08–30.32\%, 19.65\% on average) and a high-sulfur content (1.75–9.25\%, 3.43\% on average). Critical elements including Li, Ga, Nb, Ta, REY are enriched in the coal. Minerals in the Daping coal are mainly clay minerals (including illite, mixed layer of illite/smectite (I/S), kaolinite, and chamosite) and pyrite, and to a lesser extent, calcite, anatase, and marcasite, with traces of zircon, celestite, and baddeleyite. Lithium is mainly associated with illite, and Ga, Nb, Ta, and REY also have an inorganic affinity. The terrigenous materials of the Daping coal were from the intermediate-felsic rocks at the top of the Kangdian Upland rather than the basalts. Hydrothermal solutions also make a great contribution to the enrichment of critical elements and minerals. High-temperature solutions (>200 °C) may be responsible for the weakly negative Eu anomalies. The coal ashes in the Daping Mine have significant concentrations of Li2O (2583 ppm on average), Ga (83.5 ppm on average), (Nb, Ta)2O5 (143 ppm on average), and REO (oxides of REY, 1125 ppm on average), all of which are higher than their respective cut-off grades. Moreover, the floor strata are enriched in these critical elements. Thus, the coal ashes and floor strata are potential resources for extraction of these critical elements.}

abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},
